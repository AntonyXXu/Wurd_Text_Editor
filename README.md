# Wurd Text Editor in C++
Created logic and data structures behind a simple text editor, capable of spellcheck, undo, loading, and saving. A list of strings keeps track of all the lines of text with an iterator keeping track of the current line. I used a Trie to implement the spell checker, and a stack to maintain undo functions. Note I did not create the GUI, only the logic and algorithms to make the editor work. I built the StudentTextEditor.cpp/h, StudentUndo.cpp/.h, and the StudentSpellCheck.cpp/.h files.

This project was created based on UCLA CS-32 Data Structures and Algorithms Project 4 in 2021. Spec sheet is attached.
